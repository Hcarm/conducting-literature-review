## Infrastructure Status

| Server | Status | Auth | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| PubMed | {{Available / Unavailable / Rate-Limited}} | {{Authenticated / Unauthenticated}} | |
| Semantic Scholar | {{Available / Unavailable / Rate-Limited}} | {{Authenticated / Unauthenticated}} | |
| WebSearch | {{Available / Unavailable}} | N/A | |

**Degraded Mode**: {{None / Partial (specify) / Web + Grey Literature Only}}

---

## Research Goals

**Primary Research Question**: {{question}}

**Methodological Needs**: {{what the user needs literature for -- introduction, methods, discussion, all}}

**Exclusions**: {{what is NOT relevant}}

---

## Artifact Intake Record

| Artifact Type | Provided? | What Extracted |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Specific Aims | | |
| Manuscript draft | | |
| IRB application | | |
| Known exemplar article(s) | | |
| Existing reference list | | |
| Project code | | |

**Pre-populated references**: {{N}} papers from artifact intake (excluded from convergence denominator)

---

## Core Concepts

<!-- Minimum 2, maximum 5 concepts. At least one concept must have Target Depth of Moderate or Strong. -->

| Concept | Search Terms | Cross-Disciplinary Variants | Target Depth |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| | | | {{Strong / Moderate / Any}} |
| | | | {{Strong / Moderate / Any}} |

**Question Type**: {{Clinical therapy / Methodological / Cross-disciplinary hybrid / Exploratory}}

**Negative-Framing Modifier**: {{Yes / No}} -- If yes, all concepts receive negative-variant search terms (limitations of, critique of, failure of, unintended consequences of)

---

## Search Budget

<!-- Budget numbers governed by references/search-strategies.md (single source of truth). -->

| Source Type | Budget (Narrow) | Budget (Full) | Actual | Status | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Web search | 5-8 | 10-15 | | Pending | |
| Grey literature | 1-3 | 5-8 | | Pending | |
| PubMed | -- | 10-15 | | Pending | |
| Semantic Scholar | -- | 10-15 | | Pending | |
| Citation chaining | 2-3 | 5-10 | | Pending | |
| Seed-based recommendation | 1-3 | 5-10 | | Pending | |

**Budget Rule**: Budget exhaustion is a hard stop. If concept coverage gaps remain at budget exhaustion, the user is consulted via AskUserQuestion for a targeted extension.

## Search Status by Source

<!-- Updated after each source type completes. Write "In Progress" status BEFORE first query per source. -->

| Source Type | Status | Queries Planned | Queries Executed | Results | New Unique | Last Updated |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-----------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Web search | Pending | | | | | |
| Grey literature | Pending | | | | | |
| PubMed | Pending | | | | | |
| Semantic Scholar | Pending | | | | | |
| Citation chaining | Pending | | | | | |
| Seed-based recommendation | Pending | | | | | |

## Citation Chaining Progress

| Seed Paper | PMID/DOI | Forward Results | Backward Results | New Papers | Status |
|------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| | | | | | |

---

## Convergence Tracking

<!-- Convergence calculation excludes pre-populated references from artifact intake. -->

| Round | Source Type | New Papers | Overlap with Existing (%) | Cumulative Total | Notes |
|-------|------------|------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**Convergence Threshold**: >80% overlap with existing candidate list
**Round Cap**: {{3 (narrow) / 5 (full)}}

---

## Paper Tracking

<!-- Level 1 canonical schema. -->
<!-- Status values: Candidate | Included | Excluded | Level-2-Complete | Level-3-Complete | Level-4-Complete | Processed -->

| # | Citation | Source Type | Source | Relevance | Status | Exemplar? | DOI/PMID |
|---|----------|------------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| | | | | | Candidate | {{No / Yes / User-Designated / Promoted}} | |

**Total Found**: 0
**Included**: 0
**Exemplars**: 0
**Excluded**: 0

---

## Literature Density

**Classification**: {{Normal / Sparse / Not Yet Assessed}}
**Basis**: {{High convergence + low yield = Sparse; otherwise Normal}}

---

## Gaps Identified

| Gap | Concept(s) Affected | Severity | Notes |
|-----|---------------------|----------|-------|
| | | | |

---

## Concept Intersection Status

<!-- Each concept pair: "Satisfied" (connecting papers exist) or "Gap Documented" (no connecting papers; user confirmed expected). Both count as addressed for sufficiency. -->

| Concept Pair | Status | Connecting Paper(s) or Gap Reason |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| | | |

## Antagonistic Review

<!-- Full reviews only. Completed during Phase 4. -->

- [ ] Accuracy audit: claim classification (critical/supporting/contextual) and verification
- [ ] Coverage assessment: all research goals addressed
- [ ] Source independence: critical claims supported by independent sources
- [ ] Bias detection: publication year, journal, author, geographic, methodology, results
- [ ] Opposing viewpoints: searched and documented
- [ ] Exemplar validation: exemplars are best available; user-designated exemplars flagged if issues found

**Critique Summary**: {{completed during Phase 4}}

## Session Notes

<!-- Brief rationale notes for multi-session continuity. Record reasoning behind search strategy decisions, exemplar designations, scope changes. -->
