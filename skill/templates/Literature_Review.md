## {{Topic Section 1}}

### Exemplar Papers

<!-- Level 3-4 canonical schema. Each exemplar includes full entry fields plus deep extraction when full text is available. -->

#### {{Author(s) (Year)}}

- **Source**: {{journal/venue}}
- **Source Type**: {{Web search / Grey literature / PubMed / Semantic Scholar / Citation chaining / Seed-based recommendation}}
- **DOI**: {{doi}} | **Verified**: {{Yes / No / Pending / N/A}}
- **Summary**: {{2-3 sentences}}
- **Relevance**: {{to research question}}
- **Key Methods to Emulate**: {{methodological elements worth replicating}}
- **Why Exemplar**: {{justification for exemplar status}}
- **Quality Note**: {{design: [strength]; limitation: [key limitation]}}

**Deep Extraction** (Level 4 -- from full text):

- **TL;DR**: {{1-2 sentence plain-language summary}}
- **Research Question**: {{exact question the paper addresses}}
- **Identification Strategy**: {{causal or analytic approach}}
- **Data**: {{sources, unit of observation, N, time period}}
- **Statistical Specifications**: {{models, covariates, sensitivity analyses}}
- **Key Finding with Effect Size**: {{primary result with 95% CI or SE}}
- **Contributions**: {{what the paper adds beyond prior work}}
- **Replication Feasibility**: {{could this be reproduced with user's data and tools?}}
- **Author-Noted Limitations**: {{self-identified weaknesses}}

<!-- If full text unavailable, mark fields: "N/A -- full text required" or "Abstract only: [partial info]" -->

### Supporting Papers

<!-- Level 2 canonical schema. Brief annotation for each supporting paper. -->

#### {{Author(s) (Year)}}

- **Source**: {{journal/venue}}
- **Source Type**: {{Web search / Grey literature / PubMed / Semantic Scholar / Citation chaining / Seed-based recommendation}}
- **DOI**: {{doi}} | **Verified**: {{Yes / No / Pending / N/A}}
- **Summary**: {{1-2 sentences}}
- **Quality Note**: {{design: [strength]; limitation: [key limitation]}}

---

### Demoted Exemplars

<!-- Papers originally designated as exemplars but reclassified during Phase 4 antagonistic review. Level 4 data retained for reference. -->

#### {{Author(s) (Year)}} -- Demoted

- **Demotion Reason**: {{reason from antagonistic review}}
- **Original Deep Extraction**: {{retained Level 4 fields as above}}

---

### Evidence Table

<!-- Compiled from Level 4 deep extraction of exemplar papers in this topic section. -->

| Exemplar | TL;DR | Method | Data (N, period) | Key Finding | Effect Size (95% CI) | Replication? |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| | | | | | | |

<!-- For abstract-only exemplars: "Abstract only -- [available fields]" -->
<!-- If exemplars were demoted after evidence table compilation: "Originally designated exemplar; demoted during antagonistic review due to [reason]." -->

---

## Key Methodological Insights

{{Synthesis of methodological patterns across exemplar papers}}

## Quantitative Summary

{{Summary of effect sizes and confidence intervals across studies, where applicable}}

## Gaps and Limitations

{{Known gaps in the literature, limitations of the evidence base, areas for future research}}

**Literature Density**: {{Normal / Sparse -- from REVIEW_PROGRESS.md}}

{{If Sparse: "Despite comprehensive search across N sources with M queries, only K relevant papers were identified. The high convergence rate (X%) suggests this reflects genuine literature sparsity rather than search inadequacy."}}
